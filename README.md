# Language Detection Neural Network

This project was heavily inspired by the following 2 videos. 
* [Sriraj Raval's video on how to make a neural network in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p69khggr1Jo&feature=youtu.be)
* [Cary K Huang's video on detecting languages with neural nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evTx5BoKcc8)

All the files in data were directly taken from Huang's code, found [here](https://github.com/carykh/neuralNetworkLanguageDetection)

Requires numpy.
